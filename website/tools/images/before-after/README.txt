Before & After images for the template (local use only)
========================================================

Copy your 4 "before" photos into this folder and name them:

  before-1.png   → main "Before" panel (e.g. weathered railing)
  before-2.png   → grid (e.g. red/black railings)
  before-3.png   → grid (e.g. metal railing close-up)
  before-4.png   → grid (e.g. stone building exterior)

When you have an "after" photo, add it as:

  after-1.png    → main "After" panel

Then open the HTML file locally (do not use the live website):
  website/tools/before-after-template.html
Double-click to open in your browser, then take a screenshot.
This folder is not deployed to the live site.
