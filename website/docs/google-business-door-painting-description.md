**Character count: ~520** (under typical limits)

Professional door painting in Bath and the surrounding area. I paint interior and exterior doors — front doors, internal doors, French doors, and door frames — with proper preparation and quality paint for a lasting finish. I strip or sand existing paint where needed, fill any damage, prime bare wood, and apply two coats for a smooth, durable result. Front doors are finished in weather-resistant paint; internal doors and frames are matched to your chosen colour and finish. Free, no-obligation quotes. I cover Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Trowbridge, Chippenham, Rode, Melksham, Bradford on Avon, Frome and surrounding villages.
