## On your website

You already use **house painter Bath** and **house painting Bath** in your SEO keywords (`lib/seo-keywords.ts`). The phrase can also appear naturally in:

- Hero or intro copy (e.g. “Professional house painter in Bath and BANES”).
- Area pages (e.g. “House painter in Keynsham” in the intro).
- Meta descriptions where it fits.

You don’t need a separate “House painting” service page — your existing Interior and Exterior painting pages cover the work; “house painter” is the search term and category you’re targeting in GBP and in copy.

Use the **full description** in GBP if the field allows it; otherwise use the **300-character** or **shorter** version.
