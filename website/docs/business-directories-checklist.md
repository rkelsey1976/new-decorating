## Priority 1 – Do these first

| Directory | Why | Status / link |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **Google Business Profile** | Shows in Google Search and Maps, reviews, “Get a quote” and local pack. Essential. | ✓ Done (review link on site) |
| **Yelp** | Used for local search and reviews; we’ve prepared your listing text. | 📄 See `yelp-business-listing.md` |
| **Bing Places** | Powers Bing and parts of other search. Quick to add if you’ve done Google. | [bingplaces.com](https://www.bingplaces.com) |
| **Apple Maps** | Used by Apple devices and some apps. Free. | [Apple Business Register](https://register.apple.com/business) (or via Apple Business Connect) |

## Priority 2 – Lead and review sites (UK / trades)

| Directory | Why | Link / notes |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| **Checkatrade** | Very trusted by UK homeowners for trades. Paid membership, but can bring serious leads. | [checkatrade.com](https://www.checkatrade.com) |
| **Trustatrader** | Similar to Checkatrade; another “vetted” trades option. | [trustatrader.com](https://www.trustatrader.com) |
| **MyBuilder** | Job-post and quote style; homeowners post jobs, you quote. | [mybuilder.com](https://www.mybuilder.com) |
| **Bark (formerly Bark.com)** | Lead/quote platform; you pay per lead or subscription. | [bark.com](https://www.bark.com) |

## Priority 3 – General and local

| Directory | Why | Link / notes |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| **Facebook** | You’re already on it; make sure “ painter and decorator ” + area are in the About and that you have a clear CTA (e.g. “Message for a quote”). | ✓ Already linked on site |
| **Thomson Local** | Classic UK directory; still used for local lookups. | [thomsonlocal.com](https://www.thomsonlocal.com) |
| **Yell.com** | UK business directory; good for consistency (name, address, phone, website). | [yell.com](https://www.yell.com) |
| **FreeIndex** | Free UK directory; quick to add. | [freeindex.co.uk](https://www.freeindex.co.uk) |
| **Scoot** | UK local directory. | [scoot.co.uk](https://www.scoot.co.uk) |
| **Bath-specific / BANES** | Any “Best of Bath”, “BANES trades” or local council/business lists. Search “Bath business directory” or “painter decorator Bath list”. | Search locally |

## Priority 4 – Optional / niche

| Directory | Why | Link / notes |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| **Houzz** | Home improvement and design; strong for decorators and painters. | [houzz.com](https://www.houzz.com) |
| **Nextdoor** | Neighbourhood app; some people ask for trades recommendations. | [nextdoor.com](https://nextdoor.com) – join as business or personal |
| **LinkedIn** | Less critical for local trades, but useful if you ever work with landlords, agents or small developers. | [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com) |

## What to use on every listing

- **Business name:** New Decorating  
- **Contact:** 07717 772881  
- **Website:** https://new-decorating.co.uk  
- **Location:** Bath (and “Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Trowbridge, Chippenham, Rode, Melksham, Bradford on Avon, Frome” where space allows)  
- **Description:** Property decorator / painter and decorator in Bath; interior & exterior painting, wallpaper, preparation & repair; 25+ years; free quotes.  
- **Categories:** Painter, Painting & Decorating, Wallpaperer (or closest match).

Use the same wording where you can so your name, address, phone and website (NAPW) are consistent everywhere – that helps local SEO.

## Suggested order

1. **Google Business Profile** – already done.  
2. **Bing Places** – copy from Google, quick.  
3. **Yelp** – use the text in `yelp-business-listing.md`.  
4. **Apple Maps** – one form, good for iPhone users.  
5. **One paid lead site** – e.g. Checkatrade or Trustatrader if you want more leads.  
6. **Trustpilot** – free, adds another place for reviews.  
7. **Yell / Thomson Local / FreeIndex** – for consistency and extra visibility.  
8. **Houzz** – if you want to focus on home-improvement and design-minded customers.

You don’t need to be on everything; a few well-kept profiles (Google, Bing, Yelp, one lead site, plus your website and Facebook) are better than lots of half-finished ones.
