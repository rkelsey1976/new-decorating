## What to use on every listing

- **Business name:** New Decorating  
- **Contact:** 07717 772881  
- **Website:** https://new-decorating.co.uk  
- **Location:** Bath (and “Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Trowbridge, Chippenham, Rode, Melksham, Bradford on Avon, Frome” where space allows)  
- **Description:** Property decorator / painter and decorator in Bath; interior & exterior painting, wallpaper, preparation & repair; 25+ years; free quotes.  
- **Categories:** Painter, Painting & Decorating, Wallpaperer (or closest match).

Use the same wording where you can so your name, address, phone and website (NAPW) are consistent everywhere – that helps local SEO.

## Suggested order

1. **Google Business Profile** – already done.  
2. **Bing Places** – copy from Google, quick.  
3. **Yelp** – use the text in `yelp-business-listing.md`.  
4. **Apple Maps** – one form, good for iPhone users.  
5. **One paid lead site** – e.g. Checkatrade or Trustatrader if you want more leads.  
6. **Trustpilot** – free, adds another place for reviews.  
7. **Yell / Thomson Local / FreeIndex** – for consistency and extra visibility.  
8. **Houzz** – if you want to focus on home-improvement and design-minded customers.

You don’t need to be on everything; a few well-kept profiles (Google, Bing, Yelp, one lead site, plus your website and Facebook) are better than lots of half-finished ones.
