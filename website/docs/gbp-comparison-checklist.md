## What matters most for local visibility

1. **Reviews** – More (and recent) 5‑star reviews usually help. If they have more, focus on asking every happy customer for a review using your link.
2. **Completeness** – Full description, service area, categories, hours. Fill every section you can.
3. **Photos** – 10+ good photos, updated regularly. Add new job photos every few weeks if you can.
4. **Posts** – Post at least every 1–2 weeks. If they post more often, match or beat that.
5. **Q&A** – Add your own Q&As (e.g. “Do you do exterior painting?”, “What areas do you cover?”) so your profile answers common questions.

## After you fill it in

- **Where you’re ahead:** Keep doing it; consider one more improvement (e.g. one more post per month).
- **Where they’re ahead:** Prioritise that (e.g. if they have more reviews, step up asking for reviews; if they post more, use drafts from `google-business-posts.md` more often).

Re-run this comparison in a few weeks to see how you’re doing. For a full plan to improve your GBP and outrank competitors, see `outperform-competitor-plan.md`.
