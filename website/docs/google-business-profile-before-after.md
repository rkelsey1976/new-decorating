# Before & After photos for Google Business Profile

Use before/after images on your **Google Business Profile** (e.g. in Posts or in the Photos section) to show the quality of your work. This doc covers how to shoot them, how to post, and suggested captions.

**Ready-to-use GBP post for your railings before/after:** see **`gbp-post-before-after-railings.md`** for copy, headline, button and step-by-step.

## Your “before” photos

You already have strong “before” shots:

1. **Weathered metal railing** – heavy rust, peeling black paint, organic growth. Ideal for a metal/railing restoration and repaint.
2. **Wrought iron railings (red and black)** – faded red gate, weathered black railings, vegetation on stone wall. Good for exterior metalwork and paint.
3. **Stone building exterior** – mossy lower facade, overgrown ground, basement area. Good for exterior cleaning, stone, and general “transformation” story.

Use the **same angle and framing** when you take the “after” photo so the comparison is clear.

## How to take matching “after” photos

- **Same spot, same angle** – stand in the same place and shoot at the same height and direction as the before.
- **Same time of day** (roughly) – so lighting is comparable and the after doesn’t look better just because of sun.
- **Same crop** – keep the same amount of background in frame so the change is obvious at a glance.
- **One clear subject** – e.g. the railing or the building facade, not a wide shot of the whole street.

## Where to use them on Google Business Profile

- **Photos** – Add the before and after as two separate images, or as one combined image (see template below).
- **Posts** – Use a single “before & after” image in a post with a short caption and a CTA (e.g. “Get a free quote”).
- **Services** – If GBP lets you add photos to a service (e.g. “Exterior painting”), use a before/after there.

## Suggested captions (when you have real “after” photos)

**Short (for post or image caption):**

- *Before and after: wrought iron railings stripped, treated and repainted. Bath.*  
- *Metal railings restored and repainted – before and after. Free quotes for painting and decorating across Bath and BANES.*  
- *Exterior metalwork: from weathered and rusty to clean and protected. New Decorating – painter & decorator in Bath.*

**With CTA:**

- *Before → After: railings repainted and protected. For interior and exterior painting across Bath, Keynsham and BANES, get a free quote – link in profile.*

Keep captions truthful: only use before/after when the “after” is your own completed work.

## Template for a single “Before & After” image

If you want **one image** that shows both (e.g. for a GBP Post):

1. **Local HTML template (screenshot only):** Open **`website/tools/before-after-template.html`** in your browser (double-click the file). Put your photos in **`website/tools/images/before-after/`** as `before-1.png` … `before-4.png` and `after-1.png` when you have it. Take a screenshot of the page — this template is for local use only and is not on the live website.
2. Or use a two-panel layout in Canva/Photoshop and drop your before and after photos into the panels.
3. Or simply place the before and after **side by side** in one image (same height, no fancy frame) and add small “Before” and “After” text if you like.

**Image size for GBP:** 1080 × 1080 px (square) or 1080 × 1350 px (portrait) work well for posts; minimum width 720 px.
