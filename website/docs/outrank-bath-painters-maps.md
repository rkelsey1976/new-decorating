# How to Outrank Bath Painters And Decorators on Maps & Local Search

Focused plan to beat **Bath Painters** (bathpainters.co.uk) in the Google local pack and Maps for searches like “painter decorator Bath”, “painters Bath”, “decorator Keynsham”.

---

## Why they rank (and what you need to match or beat)

Local pack and Maps are driven mainly by:

1. **Google Business Profile (GBP)** – Claimed, complete, with the right category and service areas.
2. **Reviews** – Number, rating, and **recency**. More recent 5-star reviews help.
3. **Profile completeness** – Description, hours, photos, posts, Q&A, services.
4. **Relevance** – Keywords in description and services; service area coverage.
5. **Citations** – Same NAP (name, address, phone, website) on your site and key directories.

Bath Painters likely rank because they have a **live GBP** with reviews, photos, and a complete profile. To outrank them you need to be **on Maps first**, then **stronger or more consistent** on these levers.

---

## Step 0: Get on Maps (you’re not there yet)

You can’t outrank anyone in the local pack until you have a **claimed, verified GBP**.

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com) and add/claim **New Decorating**.
2. Choose category **Painter** or **Painting contractor**; add **Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, BANES** as service areas.
3. Enter phone (07717 772881), website (new-decorating.co.uk), and a short description (see below).
4. **Verify** (usually by postcard to your address – you can hide the address later and show only service areas).
5. After verification, you’ll appear in Maps and become eligible for the local pack.

Until this is done, nothing below will get you above Bath Painters in Maps.

## Step 1: Make your GBP stronger than theirs

Once you’re on Maps, optimise so your profile is **more complete and more active** than Bath Painters.

| What to do | Why it helps vs Bath Painters |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Primary category** | Set to **Painter** or **Painting contractor**. Secondary: **Decorator** if available. |
| **Description (max 750 chars)** | Use “painter and decorator”, “Bath”, “Keynsham”, “BANES”, “25+ years”, “free quotes”, “interior and exterior”, “wallpaper”, “preparation and repair”. Natural, no keyword stuffing. |
| **Service areas** | Add every town you cover: Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Trowbridge, Chippenham, Rode, Melksham, Bradford on Avon, Frome, and “Bath and North East Somerset”. |
| **Opening hours** | Mon–Fri 7:30–16:30 (matches your site). |
| **Services** | Add: Interior painting, Exterior painting, Wallpaper hanging, Preparation & repair. Short descriptions; link to your service pages. |
| **Photos** | Aim for **more and more recent** than them. 10+ to start: jobs (interior/exterior), before/after if you have them, van, logo. Add new ones every few weeks. |
| **Posts** | At least every 1–2 weeks. Use drafts from `google-business-posts.md` (free quote, areas, exterior painting, etc.). Posts with a clear image and “Get quote” or “Visit site” perform well. |
| **Q&A** | Add your own: “Do you do exterior painting?”, “What areas do you cover?”, “Do you provide free quotes?” with clear answers. Reduces “asked by others” and controls the message. |
| **NAP** | Business name, phone, website must **exactly match** your website and every directory. |

Check Bath Painters’ profile (search “Bath Painters” on Google, open their Maps listing). Note their review count, number of photos, how often they post. Your goal: **more complete, more photos, more frequent posts**, and over time **more (and more recent) reviews**.

---

## Step 2: Win on reviews

Local pack and Maps weight **review count, star rating, and recency** heavily.

| Action | Why it helps |
|--------|--------------|
| **Ask every happy customer** | After each job: “If you’re happy with the work, a quick review on Google really helps” + your review link. |
| **Review link everywhere** | Contact page, footer (you have this), and in a follow-up message or email after completion. Link is in `lib/site.ts` as `GBP_REVIEW_URL` – use the real GBP “Share review form” link once you’re verified. |
| **Respond to every review** | Thank reviewers; reply professionally to any concern. Shows you’re active. |
| **Steady flow** | Aim for 1–2 new reviews a month. Consistency beats occasional bursts. |
| **No incentives** | Don’t offer money or discounts for reviews; Google can penalise. |

If Bath Painters have 20 reviews and you have 0, you won’t outrank them until you start building. If you reach similar numbers with a **higher rating** and **more recent** reviews, you have a good chance to outrank them.

## Step 3: Citations and NAP (same everywhere)

Google uses **citations** (mentions of your business on other sites) to validate and rank you.

| Action | Why it helps |
|--------|--------------|
| **Same NAP** | **New Decorating**, 07717 772881, new-decorating.co.uk, and your service areas on your site, GBP, and every directory. No variations. |
| **Free directories** | Add to the free options in `business-directories-checklist.md`: FreeIndex, Yell, Thomson Local, Find Your Local, 2day Keynsham, Hi Keynsham, Somerset Live, Touch Local, etc. Use “Bath”, “Keynsham”, “BANES” in descriptions. |
| **Bing Places & Apple Maps** | Add/claim so you’re consistent across search engines. |

The more consistent, quality citations you have, the stronger your local signal vs competitors.

---

## Step 4: Website (you’re already ahead)

Your site is already strong vs Bath Painters for **on-site local SEO**:

- 10 area pages (Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, etc.) – they don’t have the same depth.
- Service pages with FAQs and schema.
- Blog (Bath, Keynsham, Widcombe, etc.).
- Schema (LocalBusiness, areaServed, opening hours, WebSite, etc.).

**Keep doing:** Add gallery photos with descriptive alt text (e.g. “Interior painting Bath living room”). Add a blog post every few months with local keywords. When you get Google reviews, you can add a “Google reviews” or testimonials section and keep schema `aggregateRating` in sync.

Your main gap vs Bath Painters for **Maps** is not the website – it’s **being on Maps and then winning on GBP + reviews**.

## What to track (Bath Painters vs you)

| Check | How | Goal |
|-------|-----|------|
| **Local pack** | Incognito search “painter decorator Bath”, “painters Bath”, “painter Keynsham”. See who’s in the top 3 map results. | You in top 3. |
| **Their GBP** | Search “Bath Painters”, open their Maps listing. Note: review count, rating, photos count, last post date. | You match or beat on completeness, then on reviews and recency. |
| **Your GBP** | Same for “New Decorating” once live. | Complete profile; more recent posts and photos than them; growing reviews. |

Re-check every 2–4 weeks. Local rankings often shift over 4–12 weeks as you add reviews, posts, and photos.
