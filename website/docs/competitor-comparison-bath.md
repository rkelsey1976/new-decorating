## Gaps to consider (vs competitors)

| Gap | What others do | Suggestion for New Decorating |
|-----|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **"Painter" in main title** | Many use "Painter and Decorator in Bath" in `<title>`. | Your site title is "New Decorating \| Bath & BANES – Interior Painting & Decorating". Consider adding "Painter & Decorator in Bath" nearer the start for the main keyword (e.g. "Painter & Decorator in Bath \| New Decorating"). |
| **Google Business Profile** | Competitors rely on GBP for maps and reviews. | Ensure GBP exists, NAP matches site, and you collect Google reviews (and optionally surface them on site). |
| **Gallery size / alt text** | Bath Painters etc. use large galleries and descriptive filenames/alt. | You have a good gallery; keep adding projects and use descriptive alt (e.g. "Interior painting Bath living room", "Exterior painting Bath stone"). |
| **Before/after** | Some competitors use before/after sliders. | Optional: add a small before/after section or captions to gallery for key projects. |
| **Blog / guides** | A few have colour/finish guides or local case studies. | You already have a blog; keep short local/advice posts (e.g. "Decorating period homes in Bath"). |
| **Commercial** | J Hudson / Bath Painters mention commercial. | If you do commercial work, add a line and/or a small "Commercial" service or section; if not, no change. |
