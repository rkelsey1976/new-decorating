# GBP post: Before & After railings

Use this when posting your **before/after railings** image on **Google Business Profile** (Google Business → Posts → Create post).

---

## 1. Get your image

1. Open **`website/tools/before-after-template.html`** in your browser (double-click the file).
2. Take a **screenshot** of the full frame (Before | After + grid + “New Decorating” bar).
3. **Crop** so the main Before/After panel is the focus (optional: crop out the grid below if you want a simpler post).
4. **Resize** if needed: GBP works best with **1080 × 1080 px** (square) or **1080 × 1350 px** (portrait). Minimum width **720 px**.

---

## 2. Post type

- **Update** (standard post) – best for “before & after” and a short story.

---

## 3. Copy for the post

**Headline** (keep under ~58 characters):

```
Before & after: wrought iron railings, Bath
```

**Description** (paste into the post text):

```
Weathered, rusty railings stripped, treated and repainted to a clean black finish. Same spot – before and after.

Interior and exterior painting across Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton and BANES. Free, no-obligation quotes.
```

**Shorter option** (if character limit is tight):

```
Before and after: wrought iron railings stripped, treated and repainted. Bath & BANES. Free quotes.
```

## 4. Call-to-action button

- **Button text:** `Get a quote` or `Free quote`
- **Link:** `https://new-decorating.co.uk/contact`

(Add in GBP when it asks for “Button” or “Call to action”.)

## 5. In Google Business Profile

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com) and open your **New Decorating** profile.
2. Click **Posts** (or **Updates** / **Add update**).
3. **Create post** → choose **Update**.
4. **Add photo** → upload your before/after screenshot.
5. **Headline** → paste the headline above.
6. **Description** → paste the description above.
7. **Button** → set label (e.g. “Get a quote”) and URL: `https://new-decorating.co.uk/contact`.
8. **Publish**.

## 6. Optional: add to Photos too

- In GBP go to **Photos** and upload the same before/after image (and/or separate “before” and “after” photos).
- Add a short caption when prompted, e.g. *Before and after: railings repainted. Bath.*
