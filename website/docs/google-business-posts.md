# Google Business Profile – Post drafts

Use these in **Google Business Profile** → **Posts** → **New post**. Choose **Update** (or “What’s new”) for most of these. Add a **button** (e.g. “Visit site”, “Get quote”, “Book”) and link to the URL suggested for each post.

**Tip:** Post regularly (e.g. weekly or every 2 weeks). Use a clear, relevant photo (job photo, before/after, or logo) — posts with images tend to get more visibility.

## 2. Exterior painting – best time of year

**Title:**  
Exterior painting – book for spring or early autumn

**Post text:**

Spring and early autumn are the best times for exterior painting — dry weather and moderate temperatures help paint cure properly and last longer.

I paint rendered walls, windows, doors, fascias, and woodwork using weather-resistant products suited to UK conditions. Proper preparation and two coats mean a finish that protects and looks great for years.

If you’re thinking about refreshing the outside of your property, get in touch for a free quote. I cover Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock and across BANES.

## 3. Interior painting – refresh your home

**Title:**  
Interior painting – walls, woodwork and more

**Post text:**

A fresh coat of paint is one of the simplest ways to transform a room. I paint walls, ceilings, skirting boards, doors and architraves with thorough preparation and quality paint for a lasting finish.

Whether it’s one room or a full house, I use dust sheets, protect your furniture, and leave your home clean and tidy at the end of each day. Happy to work with colours and brands you’ve chosen, including Farrow & Ball and Dulux.

Front doors and exterior woodwork

**Post text:**

Your front door is the first thing visitors see. I paint interior and exterior doors — including front doors and frames — with proper preparation, primer and two coats of quality paint. Exterior doors are finished in weather-resistant paint so they stand up to the British weather.
