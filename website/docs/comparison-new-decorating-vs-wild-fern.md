## Local SEO and keywords

| Aspect | New Decorating | Wild Fern |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Areas in copy** | Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, BANES + 10 area pages with local copy | Bath, “city and surrounding areas”; testimonials mention The Circus, Wellow, Bear Flat, Newbridge, Cirencester |
| **Blog / long-tail** | 5+ articles (Widcombe & Twerton, Keynsham, preparation, colour, interior vs exterior, etc.) | “News” section; less clearly advice/long-tail focused |
| **Schema** | LocalBusiness, FAQPage, reviews, areaServed | Not checked (typical sites have basic LocalBusiness) |
| **FAQ** | Homepage FAQ + service FAQs | Not visible on homepage |

**Where you’re ahead:** 10 area pages (Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, etc.) and blog articles (Widcombe, Keynsham, prep, colour) give you more local and long-tail coverage than Wild Fern’s single “Bath and surrounding areas” approach.

## What Wild Fern does well

- **Testimonials:** 6 named testimonials with specific locations (The Circus, Wellow Village, Bear Flat, Newbridge, Old Farmhouse, Cirencester) — strong for trust and local relevance.
- **Instagram:** Embedded feed and strong use of premium brands (Farrow & Ball, Little Greene, Morris & Co) — good for visual appeal and “decorator” positioning.
- **Brands:** Very visible use of Farrow & Ball, Little Greene, Zinsser, etc. in captions and imagery.
- **Tone:** “Consultation & project management”, “personally tailored”, “clarity and consideration” — clear service positioning.

## Where New Decorating wins

- **Area coverage:** 10 area pages (Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Trowbridge, Chippenham, Rode, Melksham, Bradford on Avon, Frome) vs no dedicated area pages.
- **Blog:** 5+ advice articles (Widcombe & Twerton, Keynsham, preparation, colour, interior vs exterior) vs a “News” section — better for long-tail search and “painter Keynsham”, “decorator Widcombe”, etc.
- **Contact:** Contact form + phone + Facebook vs email + phone (form is better for low-friction enquiries).
- **Trust:** “25+ years”, “Fully insured”, “Free quotes” in clear blocks; FAQ on homepage.
- **Technical:** Next.js, schema (LocalBusiness, FAQPage, reviews, areaServed), canonical, fast load — solid technical SEO.

## Opportunities (to strengthen vs Wild Fern)

1. **Testimonials on site:** Add 3–6 short written testimonials with name and area (e.g. “Bath”, “Keynsham”) on the homepage or a Testimonials page — like Wild Fern’s, but with your own reviews (Google or Facebook).
2. **Instagram:** If you use Instagram, embed a feed or add a “Follow on Instagram” section to match their visual/social presence.
3. **Brands:** Keep name-checking Farrow & Ball, Little Greene, Dulux where relevant (you already do in places); add a line like “I use Farrow & Ball, Little Greene and Dulux” in hero or About if it fits.
4. **Consultation / project management:** If you offer it, add a line similar to “From the initial quote through to completion, I keep you informed” to mirror their positioning.
