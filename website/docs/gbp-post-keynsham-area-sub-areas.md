# GBP post: Keynsham area – sub-areas we work in

Use this when posting about your **Keynsham area coverage** and **sub-areas** (including Saltford, Bitton, etc.) on **Google Business Profile** (Google Business → Posts → Create post). Highlights the Keynsham and surrounding villages you cover.

---

## 1. Image (optional but recommended)

- **Option A:** Use a photo of a job in Keynsham or one of the sub-areas (e.g. Saltford, Bitton — period cottage, exterior, finished room). Resize to **1080 × 1080 px** (square) or **1080 × 1350 px** (portrait). Minimum width **720 px**.
- **Option B:** Your logo or a simple graphic with “Keynsham & surrounding areas” and a short list (e.g. Saltford, Bitton, Whitchurch).
- **Option C:** A local job photo from the BS31 / Keynsham area. Avoid stock images that don’t reflect your work.

## 2. Post type

- **Update** (standard post) – best for “areas we cover” and local visibility.

## 3. Copy for the post

**Headline** (keep under ~58 characters):

```
Painter & decorator in Keynsham, Saltford and nearby
```

**Alternative headline:**

```
Keynsham, Saltford, Bitton – painter & decorator
```

**Description** (paste into the post text):

```
I'm a painter and decorator covering Keynsham (BS31) and the surrounding area between Bath and Bristol. I work in Keynsham town, Saltford, Bitton, Whitchurch, Stockwood, Queen Charlton, Chewton Keynsham and nearby villages.

Interior and exterior painting, wallpaper, preparation and repair. Period cottages, Victorian terraces and new builds — I've been working in the area for over 25 years. Every job is quoted individually with a free, no-obligation quote. Get in touch to confirm I cover your street.
```

**Shorter option** (if character limit is tight):

## 4. Call-to-action button

- **Link (areas page):** `https://new-decorating.co.uk/area/keynsham`

## 6. Why this helps

- **Local SEO:** Reinforces “Keynsham”, “Saltford”, “Bitton” and other village names on your GBP.
- **Clarity:** Shows you cover the whole Keynsham area and the Bristol/Bath fringe, not just the town centre.
- **Consistency:** Matches your website’s Keynsham area page ([/area/keynsham](https://new-decorating.co.uk/area/keynsham)), which lists the same sub-areas with links.
