# GBP post: Exterior work – book your jobs in now

Use this when posting about **exterior painting and decorating** on **Google Business Profile** (Google Business → Posts → Create post). Encourages customers to book exterior work now (e.g. ahead of the better weather or to secure a slot).

---

## 1. Image (optional but recommended)

- **Option A:** A photo of a finished exterior job — repainted walls, windows, doors, railings or fascias. Resize to **1080 × 1080 px** (square) or **1080 × 1350 px** (portrait). Minimum width **720 px**.
- **Option B:** Before/after of an exterior project (e.g. railings, front door, window frames).
- **Option C:** Your logo or a simple graphic with “Exterior painting – book now” and your contact details or website.

Avoid stock images that don’t reflect your actual work.

---

## 2. Post type

- **Update** (standard post) – good for offers and seasonal prompts.
- **Offer** (if your GBP supports it) – use “Book your exterior work” as the offer title and link to contact.

---

## 3. Copy for the post

**Headline** (keep under ~58 characters):

```
Exterior painting – book your job in now
```

**Alternative headlines:**

```
Exterior work: book now for the year ahead
```

```
Book your exterior painting in now – Bath & BANES
```

**Description** (paste into the post text):

```
Exterior painting season is coming up. Walls, windows, doors, fascias, railings — I'm taking bookings now for exterior work across Bath, Keynsham and BANES.

Get your job on the list and lock in a slot. Free quote, no obligation. Book in now so you're ready when the weather is right.
```

**Shorter option** (if character limit is tight):

```
Exterior painting — walls, windows, doors, railings. Book your job in now. Bath, Keynsham, BANES. Free quote.
```

## 4. Call-to-action button

- **Button text:** `Book now` or `Get a quote` or `Free quote`
- **Link:** `https://new-decorating.co.uk/contact`

Use **Book now** or **Get a quote** so the CTA matches the “book your jobs in now” message.

(Add in GBP when it asks for “Button” or “Call to action”.)
