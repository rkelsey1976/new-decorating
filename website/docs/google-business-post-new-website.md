**Our new website is live.**

We’ve updated our online home so you can see our work, check the areas we cover, and get in touch more easily.

**On the new site you can:**
• Browse our gallery of recent painting and decorating projects  
• See our services – interior and exterior painting, wallpaper, and preparation & repair  
• Find out where we work – Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Trowbridge, Chippenham, Rode, Melksham, Bradford on Avon, Frome and surrounding areas  
• Get a free, no-obligation quote

We’re still the same local painter and decorator – 25+ years’ experience, quality finishes and fair prices. The only thing that’s changed is how easy it is to see what we do and get in touch.

**Visit the new site** using the button below, or message us here for a free quote.
