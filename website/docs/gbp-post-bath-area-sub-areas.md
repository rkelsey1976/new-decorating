# GBP post: Bath area – sub-areas we work in

Use this when posting about your **Bath area coverage** and **sub-areas** on **Google Business Profile** (Google Business → Posts → Create post). Highlights the Bath neighbourhoods and villages you cover.

---

## 1. Image (optional but recommended)

- **Option A:** Use a photo of a job in Bath or one of the sub-areas (e.g. period property, exterior, finished room). Resize to **1080 × 1080 px** (square) or **1080 × 1350 px** (portrait). Minimum width **720 px**.
- **Option B:** Your logo or a simple graphic with “Bath & BANES” and a short list of areas.
- **Option C:** A clear shot of Bath (e.g. cityscape or a recognisable street) if you have one. Avoid stock images that don’t reflect your work.

---

## 2. Post type

- **Update** (standard post) – best for “areas we cover” and local visibility.

---

## 3. Copy for the post

**Headline** (keep under ~58 characters):

```
Painter & decorator across Bath and these areas
```

**Alternative headline:**

```
Bath and surrounding areas – painter & decorator
```

**Description** (paste into the post text):

```
I'm a painter and decorator based in Bath, and I work right across the city and its surrounding areas. That includes Widcombe, Twerton, Larkhall, Combe Down, Odd Down, Bathwick, Weston, Batheaston, Bathford and the city centre.

Interior and exterior painting, wallpaper, preparation and repair. Period properties, Georgian terraces and modern homes. Every job is quoted individually — free, no-obligation quotes. Get in touch to confirm I cover your street.
```

**Shorter option** (if character limit is tight):

```
Painter and decorator across Bath: Widcombe, Twerton, Larkhall, Combe Down, Odd Down, Bathwick, Weston, Batheaston, Bathford and the city centre. Interior, exterior, wallpaper. Free quotes.
```

## 4. Call-to-action button

- **Button text:** `View areas` or `Get a quote` or `Free quote`
- **Link (areas page):** `https://new-decorating.co.uk/area/bath`
- **Link (contact):** `https://new-decorating.co.uk/contact`

Use the **area page** if you want to send people to the full Bath + sub-areas list; use **contact** for a direct quote CTA.

(Add in GBP when it asks for “Button” or “Call to action”.)

## 5. In Google Business Profile

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com) and open your **New Decorating** profile.

## 6. Why this helps

- **Local SEO:** Reinforces “Bath” and neighbourhood names (Widcombe, Twerton, Larkhall, etc.) on your GBP.
- **Clarity:** Shows you’re not just “Bath city” but cover the suburbs and villages.
- **Consistency:** Matches your website’s Bath area page ([/area/bath](https://new-decorating.co.uk/area/bath)), which lists the same sub-areas with links.
